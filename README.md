ðŸ“‚ File Handling Practice in Python
This repository contains solutions to 11 important file handling questions in Python.
Each question is solved with clean and beginner-friendly code.

ðŸ“‹ List of Questions
1. Check if a file contains the word "twinkle"
Reads poems.txt.

Checks whether the word "twinkle" exists in the file (case-insensitive).

2. Update Hi-score if a new score is higher
Reads Hi-score.txt.

Compares the score returned by the game() function with the existing Hi-score.

Updates the file if the new score is higher.

3. Generate multiplication tables (2 to 20)
Generates multiplication tables from 2 to 20.

Saves each table into a separate file inside a folder named for a 13-year-old student.

Example files:

Multiplication_Table_of_2.txt

Multiplication_Table_of_3.txt

...

Multiplication_Table_of_20.txt

4. Replace "Donkey" with "#####"
Opens a file containing multiple occurrences of the word "Donkey".

Replaces every occurrence with "#####" and updates the same file.

5. Replace a list of censored words
Same as Question 4, but handles multiple censored words (like "Donkey", "Idiot", "Stupid", etc.).

All censored words are replaced with "#####" in the file.

6. Search for the word "python" in a log file
Mines a log file.

Checks if the word "python" appears anywhere inside the file.

7. Find line number where "python" is present
Reads the log file line-by-line.

Prints the line numbers where the word "python" is found.

8. Make a copy of a text file
Makes an exact copy of the given file this.txt.

Saves it as this_copy.txt.

9. Check if two files are identical
Compares two files byte-by-byte.

Reports whether their content is identical or different.

10. Wipe out the content of a file
Empties a file by overwriting its content to an empty string.

(After running, the file will be blank.)

11. Rename a file
Renames a given file to:

bash
Copy
Edit
renamed_by_python.txt
